#Trying out string formatters

my_age= 26
my_star_sign= 'Aquarius'

# Important lesson to remember. The book does not close all comands with parenthesis . You have to open and close all parenthesis to execute without errors.

#Trying to use more formatted strings

#The following text will make no sense at all

a = 'Thanks to Jason I have written %d lines of code.' %25
b = 'A lot of this still doesnt make too much sense its like a toy'

print (a+b) 
print ("Coders find this interesting but %s ." % b)
